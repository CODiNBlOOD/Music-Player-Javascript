In today's world, technology is growing very fast, and we are getting in touch with different new technologies day by day.

**#What is Artificial Intelligence?**


Here, one of the booming technologies of computer science is Artificial Intelligence which is ready to create a new revolution in the world by making intelligent machines.Artificial Intelligence is now all around us. It is currently working with a variety of subfields,  such as self-driving cars, playing chess, proving theorems, playing music, Painting, etc.

Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence, where Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", hence AI means "a man-made thinking power."

"So, we can define AI as: It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, thinks like humans, and able to make decisions.

Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human-based skills such as learning, reasoning, and solving problems

With Artificial Intelligence you do not need to pre program a machine to do some work, despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with your own intelligence, and that is the awesomeness of AI.

It is believed that AI is not a new technology, and some people say that as per Greek myth, there were Mechanical men in the early days who can work and behave like humans.


##Why AI??

Before Learning about Artificial Intelligence, we should know what is the importance of AI and why should we learn it. Following are some main reasons to learn about AI:

With the help of AI, you can create software or devices which can solve real-world problems very easily and with accuracy such as health issues, marketing, traffic issues, etc.
With the help of AI, you can create your personal virtual Assistant, such as Cortana, Google Assistant, Siri, etc.
With the help of AI, you can build such Robots which can work in an environment where the survival of humans can be at risk.


###Goals of AI?

Replicate human intelligence
Solve Knowledge-intensive tasks
An intelligent connection between perception and action
Building a machine which can perform tasks that requires human intelligence such as:
Proving a theorem
Playing chess
Plan some surgical operation
Driving a car in traffic
Creating some system which can exhibit intelligent behaviour, learn new things by itself, demonstrate, explain, and can advise its user.

####Advantages of Artificial Intelligence


The following are some main advantages of Artificial Intelligence:


High Accuracy with fewer errors: AI machines or systems are prone to fewer errors and high accuracy as it takes decisions as on pre-experience or information.

High-Speed: AI systems can be of very high-speed and fast-decision making, and because of that AI systems can beat a chess champion in the Chess game.

High reliability: AI machines are highly reliable and can perform the same action multiple times with high accuracy.

Useful for risky areas: AI machines can be helpful in situations such as defusing a bomb, or exploring the ocean floor, and employing a human can be risky.

Digital Assistant: AI can be very useful to provide digital assistance to the users such as AI technology is currently used by various E-commerce websites to show products as per customer requirements.
Useful as a public utility: AI can be very useful for public utilities such as a self-driving cars which can make our journey safer and hassle-free, facial recognition for security purposes, Natural language processing to communicate with humans in human language, etc.


#####Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence

Every technology has some disadvantages, and the same goes for Artificial intelligence. Being so advantageous technology still, has some disadvantages which we need to keep in our mind while creating an AI system. The following are the disadvantages of AI:

High Cost: The hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as it requires lots of maintenance to meet current world requirements.
Can't think out of the box: Even though we are making smarter machines with AI, but still they cannot work out of the box, as the robot will only do the work for which they are trained, or programmed.

No feelings and emotions: AI machines can be an outstanding performers, but still it does not have the feeling so they cannot make any kind of emotional attachment to humans, and may sometime be harmful to users if the proper care is not taken.
Increase dependency on machines: With the increment of technology, people are getting more dependent on devices and hence they are losing their mental capabilities.
No Original Creativity: Humans are so creative and can imagine some new ideas but still AI machines cannot beat this power of human intelligence and cannot be creative and imaginative.
