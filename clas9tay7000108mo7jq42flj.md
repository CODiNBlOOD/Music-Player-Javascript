# What is Forward and backward Chaining in AI?

Introduction to the Expert System

A brief overview of an expert system can help us gain more insights into the origin of backward and forward chaining in artificial intelligence.

An expert system is a computer application that uses rules, approaches, and facts to provide solutions to complex problems. Examples of expert systems include MYCIN and DENDRAL.
MYCIN uses the backward chaining technique to diagnose bacterial infections.
DENDRAL employs forward chaining to establish the structure of chemicals.
